In a nutshell, Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server. 
Built with Java, it provides over 1600 [plugins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) to support automating virtually anything, 
so that humans can actually spend their time doing things machines cannot.

# What to Use Jenkins for and When to Use It

- Building projects
- Running tests to detect bugs and other issues as soon as they are introduced
- Static code analysis
